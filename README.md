# Introduction

## What

## Why

# Getting Started

(1) Specify Amplify as a dependency in your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.stkent:amplify:0.1.0'
}
```
    
(2) Initialize the state tracker in your `Application` class:

```java
public class ExampleApplication extends Application {
    
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        
        AmplifyStateTracker.get(this).configureWithDefaults()
    }
    
}
```

(3) Add an `AmplifyView` instance to all xml layouts in which you may want to prompt the user for their feedback:

```xml
<com.github.stkent.amplify.views.AmplifyView
    android:id="@+id/amplifyView"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content" />
```

(4) Call the state tracker's `promptIfReady` method when appropriate, passing in your `AmplifyView` instance:

```java
AmplifyView amplifyView = (AmplifyView) findViewById(R.id.amplifyView);

AmplifyStateTracker.get(context).promptIfReady(amplifyView);
```

## Conventions

Code committed to this project must pass selected style and correctness checks provided by:

- [FindBugsâ„¢](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/);
- [PMD](https://pmd.github.io/);
- [checkstyle](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/).

This helps us focus on content only when reviewing contributions.

You can run these checks locally by executing the following Gradle command:

```shell
./gradlew amplify:check
```

Travis CI runs the same checks for each pull request and marks the build as failing if any check does not pass. Detailed information about every detected violation will be automatically posted to the conversation for that pull request. Violation detection and reporting is handled by the [Gnag](https://github.com/btkelly/gnag) Gradle plugin.

## Running Tests

Execute the library unit test suite using the Gradle command:

```shell
./gradlew amplify:testRelease
```

The Travis CI pull request build will fail if any test fails.

## Generating Inline Licenses

Automatically generate license headers in new source files using the Gradle command:

```shell
./gradlew licenseFormat
```

The Travis CI pull request build will fail if any source files is missing this generated header.
