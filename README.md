# Getting Started

In your `build.gradle`:

    dependencies {
        compile 'com.github.stkent:amplify:0.1.0'
    }
    
In your `Application` class:

    public class ExampleApplication extends Application {
        @Override public void onCreate() {
            super.onCreate();
            AmplifyStateTracker.get(this)
                    .configureWithDefaults()
                    .setLogLevel(BuildConfig.DEBUG ? Logger.LogLevel.DEBUG : Logger.LogLevel.NONE);
        }
    }

In your xml layout(s):

    <com.github.stkent.amplify.views.AmplifyView
        android:id="@+id/amplifyView"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content" />

In the corresponding `Activity`/`Fragment`/`View` class (typically presented immediately after a successfully-completed 'transaction'):

    final AmplifyView amplifyView = (AmplifyView) findViewById(R.id.amplifyView);
    
    ...
    
    AmplifyStateTracker.get(this).promptIfReady(amplifyView);

## Conventions

Code style and correctness is also enforced by several checkers. Running the Gradle command

    ./gradlew amplify:check
    
will perform all the standard `check` tasks, as well as noting any violations detected by:

- [FindBugsâ„¢](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/);
- [PMD](https://pmd.github.io/);
- [checkstyle](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/).

The Travis CI pull request build will fail if any violations are detected; these violations will be reported as top-level comments on the corresponding pull request.

## Running Tests

Execute the library unit test suite using the Gradle command:

    ./gradlew amplify:testRelease
    
The Travis CI pull request build will fail if any test fails.

## Generating Inline Licenses

Automatically generate license headers in new source files using the Gradle command:

    ./gradlew licenseFormat
    
The Travis CI pull request build will fail if any source files is missing this generated header.
